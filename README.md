# rngtest
This is a bare-bones library intended to demonstrate how a python library could define a library-wide RNG using NumPy's new-style API instead of `numpy.random.seed()`, as well as a number of different examples for how users of the library could integrate this into their own code for consistent usage. The main idea is to move away from using `np.random.seed()`, which all but ensures that a library cannot be used in a multi-processing or parallel computation context, but still easily manage shared, consistent and reproducible random states across all the libraries in a project that may need it.

Readers are recommended to check out the provided [examples](src/) that cover various scenarios in which an arbitrary library that utilizes pseudo-random number generators may be imported and used. The only pieces of code relevant to adopting a similar scheme in any existing library can be found [here](src/rngtest/common/__init__.py) (defining the library-wide RNG), [here](src/rngtest/sub1/sub1test.py) (using the library-wide RNG in the library itself) and [here](src/__init__.py) (importing the RNG in the top-level of the library).
